# **Falkor ESLint Config**

Shared ESLint configuration module to be used with the Falkor Framework.

`// TODO`

## **Further Development**

### **Versioning and Branching Strategy**

Release sources can be found on the `master` branch, this one always points to the latest tagged release. Previous sources of releases can be found using `git` version tags (or browsing GitHub releases). Released packages can be found on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-cspell-config "Visit").

The repository's main branch is `develop` (due to technical reasons), this holds all developments that are already decided to be included in the next release. Usually this branch is ahead of `master` one patch version (but based on upcoming features to include this can become minor, or major), so prepared external links may yet be broken.

The `feature/*` branches usually hold ideas and POC code, these will only be merged into `develop` once their impact measured and quality meets release requirements.

> _The project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org "Visit"), `git` tags are prefixed with a `v` character._

### **Free and Open Source**

The latest sources can always be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-cspell-config "Visit").
